while watching today's menu for emiya family (衛宮さんちの今日のごはん, Emiya-sanchi no Kyō no Gohan) a fate/stay night spinoff they showed a version of baked fish which looked realy good. so i wanted to try it.
sometimes when watching anime can be usefull.

ingredience:

- a half salmon steak
- carrots
- onions
- mushrooms
- salt
- peper
- butter

the ingredience have no measurement because its a more of approximation of your own liking.

instructions:

1. put salt and pepper powder on the fish over night for a good marination
2. cut carrots in small sticks, slice the onions, cut the mushrooms into slices
3. put the vegetable on a sheet of aluminium foil a base for the fish
4. put the fish on top of it (if you had not time for marination put salt and pepper on both sides)
5. put a small piece of butter on top of the fish
6. **!IMPORTANT!**: fold the aluminium to a package so that the fish is sealed, air-thight
7. now you can cook it in a pan for arount 30 minutes on medium heat. Alternatively you can cook it in a oven on two sided heat at 150°C for at least 45 to 60 minutes. The time is really not the issue it can also stay longer but keep that in mind to avoid overchooking.

done
