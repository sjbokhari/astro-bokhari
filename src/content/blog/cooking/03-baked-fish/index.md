While watching today's menu for Emiya family (衛宮さんちの今日のごはん, Emiya-sanchi no Kyō no Gohan) a fate/stay night spinoff they showed a version of baked fish which looked wonderful. So I wanted to try it.
Sometimes watching anime can be useful in real life.

Ingredients:

- a half salmon steak
- carrots
- onions
- mushrooms
- salt
- pepper
- butter

the ingredients have no measurement because it's a more of approximation of your own liking.

Instructions:

1. put salt and pepper powder on the fish overnight for a good marination
2. cut carrots in small sticks, slice the onions, cut the mushrooms into slices
3. put the vegetable on a sheet of aluminium foil, a base for the fish
4. put the fish on top of it (if you had no time for marination, put salt and pepper on both sides)
5. put a small piece of butter on top of the fish
6. **!IMPORTANT!**: fold the aluminium to a package so that the fish is sealed, airtight
7. now you can cook it in a pan for around 30 minutes on medium heat. Alternatively, you can cook it in an oven on two-sided heat at 150°C for at least 45 to 60 minutes. The time is really not the issue, it can also stay longer but keep that in mind to avoid overcooking.

Done
