So you decided to make the wrappers yourself. For this you will need only Flour, Water, Starch and Salt.

For making 20 pieces of wrappers

- 250g flour
- 25g potato starch
- 4g salt
- 140ml water

1. boil water and dissolve salt into it
2. mix potato starch and flower
3. pass it though a sieve into a bowl
4. mix, carefully, water into the flower to form a dough. Sip little by little and mix with each iteration
5. when formed a dough, knead it for 5 minutes. Coat the work surface a little bit with flour/starch
6. wrap the dough with cling film and let the dough rest for 30 min
7. flat out the dough onto some potato starch and make a 2-3mm thick sheet.
8. Cut out circles and dust some potato starch onto it, so it won't stick to each other when stabling
9. when you cannot cut out more, form again a dough and repeat the process
10. cover the finished product with a kitchen towel

done
